python knn.py

Parameters such as the range of K values (ks) to be tested and how many times (trials) those values 
should be evaluated.

After running our program several times, the most accurate values for K that our program suggests tend 
to be between 7 and 9, inclusive. As expected, the more I increased parameter 'trials', the more consistent
my data seemed to became.
